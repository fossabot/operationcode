To leaders of the Tech Industry,

I remember being taught at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (Boot Camp), that discrimination wasn’t going to fly in the Marine Corps.

“We see shades of green,” my drill instructor would say. “Some are light green and others are dark green, but all Marines are mean, green machines. It doesn’t matter the race or gender the person next to you when they save your life on the battlefield.”

> **Boot camp would be the foundation of Marine equality for me.**

Having grown up as a minority in a small rural town, the phrase “black kid” was commonly used to distinguish me from the others. This didn’t happen in the Corps. We were all just “Marine”.

Walking down the street and hearing “Hey Marine!” was a confusing time for most junior enlisted Marines. No one knew who was about to get scolded so most people froze in fear of walking away and disrespecting a Staff NCO or Officer.

While stationed overseas, I worked with personnel from many militaries around the world. People often marveled at the talented all our forces. Men and women alike were highly respected and often praised at their job proficiency.

This hasn’t been easy. Many times damning policies on gender, race, and transgender equality were upheld to Military customs and traditions. However equality is a tradition that the Marine Corps was established in. A colored man known only as “Orange” enlisted in the historical Tun Tavern (considered to be the birthplace of the Marine Corps) and sailed and fought next to General George Washington at the Battle of Princeton. Even before they were allowed, African Americans had been included.

In my time of service, I saw the removal of the 17 year policy [“Don’t ask don’t tell”](http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65381) allowing servicemembers to be open about their sexual orientation and allow all spouses to [receive equal benefits](http://archive.defense.gov/News/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=119260). We celebrated as my white wife and I shared vows and our platoon helped serve as the preparation team. Three of my groomsmen were brothers-in-arms. Shortly after, I witnessed the celebration of one of my female Marines as she married her long-standing partner of the same gender. The same respects were held in each case.

Recently, the Department of Defense ruled [transgender individuals could now serve openly in the US Military](http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0616_transgender-policy). Also the Marine Corps has personally opened previously “men-only” jobs up to all genders and has replaced the word man with Marine in 19 of it’s job titles. The Marine Corps is a world renowned machine that only gets stronger as the people that make up its gears become more entwined.

The Marine Corps is steeped in tradition. There is “the Crucible” a three day challenge that all recruits must complete earn their “Eagle, Globe, and Anchor” and earn the title Marine. The “yellow footprints” strike fear and excitement into every recruit to enter Parris Island. There is even the illustrious uniforms and standards that show the professional look and appearance of every Marine. The Marine Corps ball is a time where Marines look better than anyone else and celebrate their birthday and the many traditions still upheld. The Marine Corps has learned that traditions aren’t broken when equality is enforced. Instead new traditions of familial loyalty, protection, and respect are instilled.

I still observe the Marine Corps birthday. As a veteran and civilian I look at the history in my lifetime that the Marine Corps has made in equality and I smile. I also look at my current industry and wonder how the technology field can learn from this institution that has progressively pushed for equality by teaching and enforcing it at all levels. The Marine Corps is still predominantly white and predominantely male, but it is tearing down barrier after barrier to ensure that all people who desire to serve their country have a chance to become one of “The few and the Proud”.

The Marine Corps has over a 200 year head start but there has never been a better time to push for equality. Your team will continue to be strong and as people are unified under a name bigger than theirs the face of your company will begin to change shape and complexion. The gears will grow closer and the machine will operate at levels beyond imagine.

I encourage you to push forward and educate your team and instill a level of comradery that exceeds the bounds of race, and gender. Remove obstacles that impede your company’s progress and foster an encouraging and accepting environment for your team. Most important, turn inclusivity into a tradition that people will be proud to be a part of.

Oorah!
