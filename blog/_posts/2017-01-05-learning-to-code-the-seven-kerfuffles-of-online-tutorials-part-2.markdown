So we’ve gone through the tutorials! You now know how to install NPM, update Homebrew, have worked on a couple small issues on Open Source Projects and sort of fix your own merge conflicts. You want to move on to the next step. You want to expand your knowledge and move on to a coding bootcamp or a college. You start looking into some, a couple have mixed reviews, some have really good reviews, and some have really bad reviews. You want to do this, but you don’t want to spend ANY more time doing the crummy desk job that you’re doing now, and you can barely make ends meet as it is. Well just like the last time, there’s some pros and cons to both, HOWEVER this ain’t about the pros lemme tell ya. So before I start to ramble, let’s get right into it:

### Kerfuffle The First: Minimum Skills, Minimum Pay

We see it all over the place, “Learn to code and earn six figures!!!!!!”. I don’t think there isn’t a coding bootcamp or college that isn’t telling people this. Like you’re going to finish Bloc and start a 100k a year job in the industry without any prior experience….riiigggghhtttt….and if you believe that I have this code bootcamp that’ll teach you how you build games in 4 weeks and….wait, you don’t believe me? You shouldn’t believe me, and you definitely shouldn’t believe them, at the end of any training, be it college, or a bootcamp or a correspondence course, or an online tutorial, you will have probably the most minimal of tech skills. You’ll be able to write some simple algorithms and maybe some simple methods, but nothing complex. At best you’ll have maybe one to two fully realized fully functional apps, however they’ll be built with the bare minimum of techniques which brings me to my next point which is less the fault of the schools and more the fault of people who go to the schools………

### Kerfuffle The Second: They Don’t Teach You Everything You Need For Your Career

You can’t expect to walk into a 20+ week program and walk out of it with EVERYTHING you need for a 15+ year career in development, not even for a 5 year career. What you learned while at bootcamp is pretty much good for what you need to know for your first year, and it’s not feasible, nor smart to put all of your stock into attending a bootcamp. It won’t make all your “Dreams come true!” and get you a big ass house or big ole car till your a few years in…….

Let’s take a look at a scenario here, Let’s take three people, person one has 10 years as a developer under their belt, they’re going to a code school to refresh their skills because they recently left their last job for one reason or another, person 2 has no development experience but has 4 years in tech already, they’ve done tech support, played around with some low grade scripting, and started futzing around with python to help fix and expedite some tasks at work that are small enough to not need a human touch most of the time, but there are enough of them to cause someone to take alot of time out of the work day to go through and fix all of them. Person 3 is someone who has no tech background, has no development experience, but started doing courses on Code School, and decided that yes! Development was something that they wanted to get into.

Person 1 will graduate from Developer Academy, and most likely find a 100k a year job, because they already have experience, already know how to fix merge conflicts and went in understanding the basics of development. They were able to blow everyone away with their final project and they got a job on the spot at graduation.

Person 2 will graduate from Developer Academy, and most likely find a job that’s around Junior level, but their tech support experience will factor into it because while they are new to development, they picked up some things during the bootcamp, and was able to add to what they already learned.

Person 3 will graduate from Developer Academy, and most like find an apprenticeship, because though they went to the same bootcamp, as Person 1 and Person 2, they are completely new to tech. In fact, before getting into development, they worked as a photographer.

This also applies to college, anywhere you go for training, you will ALWAYS get the minimum of what you need to get started, unless you are returning for a masters or doctorate. Keep in mind what experience you have walking in, if you have 0 experience, you can pretty much hang up any notion of a 6 figure income in your first year.

### Kerfuffle The Third: All They Seem To Want Is Your Money

Let’s look at this this way, say you’re looking for a car, and you go online to find it, you enter your email on the site to ask a question, you get your question answered, and decide not to buy the car after all. Well now they have your email, and congrats you’re now the proud owner of a bunch of spam around sales time, christmas time, summer time, and really just all year round.

Coding bootcamps are no different, and neither are colleges. If you show the SMALLEST bit of interest in their program or school, you’ll end up with phone call, after phone call, and email after email. They’ll hit you with the click-baity “Diversity Scholarship” or “Scholarship for Women In Tech” and it’ll be 1000 bucks off of a twelve, thirteen or 14k program. And if you’ve looked into more than one program, well good luck, cause that’s all your emails from now on. It even gets to the point where you can pretty much set a watch to them:

> “Oh crap summer is coming time for the ‘change your career for summer emails……..”

> “Crap it’s almost new years, time for the ‘NEW YEAR! NEW CAREER!’ emails…..”

Seriously can set my calendar to these, everything they do is a sales pitch:

> “We have hot chocolate and donuts every morning at this bootcamp, and catered lunch ever afternoon”

> “Our bootcamp has an arcade in it and a bouncey house”

Or my favorite,

> “Our graduates go off to work at places like Github! And AirBnB! And Twitter!”

Even if they’ve had ONE person in the entire history of their bootcamp go off and find a job at one of those places, they will advertise it………and 9 times out of 10, the person who got the job at Github, or Twitter, went out to get it themselves, and it’s not even necessarily because they went to that bootcamp.

### Kerfuffle The Fourth: Diversity Scholarships That Cover Almost NOTHING

Every single bootcamp has a diversity scholarship. Every single one. And I wouldn’t even really call it a scholarship…I’d call it a discount, a scholarship should cover a pretty good amount.

Great example of that is [Bloc](https://medium.com/@trybloc)’s Veteran Scholarship with [Operation Code](https://medium.com/@operation_code) ([http://try.bloc.io/operation-code-bootcamp-scholarship/](http://try.bloc.io/operation-code-bootcamp-scholarship/)). Now don’t get me wrong, depending on what program you pick, you’ll still be paying out the nose BUT if you go through one of their lower cost programs like say their UX/UI program it’ll take a grand off of a 5k coding education, and that’s pretty cool if you ask me.

Others? We’re talking 500 bucks off of a program that makes you put a grand down up front and the rest is between 10k-20k. Does that sound like a scholarship to you? Wanna know why? Go back and read the title of the third kerfuffle.

But who benefits from these diversity scholarships? Are we talking about someone who works their butt off, is underpaid and over worked? Are we talking about those of us who otherwise cannot afford to switNope! Because they can still afford to either pay for the rest of the program OR they haven’t gone into debt and can pay for it by using one of the many MANY MANY lending services that are out there that can pay for it up front for them for the low low price of between 300–800 dollars a month! While you’re supposed to be attending a FULL TIME PROGRAM and feed, clothe and shelter yourself for the 6–7–8 months you’re supposed to be attending said program. Oh and let’s not forget, that A LOT of these bootcamps are located in cities where rent is also RIDICULOUSLY expensive.

### Kerfuffle The Fifth: The Overall Cost Is Too Damn High!

Alot of these programs are located smack dab downtown in the middle of citites like Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco. If you are attending one of these illustrious institutions, you usually tend to have to live outside of the area prompting you to either own a vehicle while attending (which in itself is a headache, parking is expensive and let’s not forget TRAFFIC), or take public transportation (Most places stop running at around midnight to one or 2am, so good luck staying late to finish something).

Apartments in these areas can range from 1000 to 3200 dollars, meaning you will more than likely be crammed into a small apartment with between 3–6 people. Let’s not forget things like utilities, internet, and your regular everyday stuff like food and clothes. You will most likely not be working seeing as these programs REQUIRE you to be there 40 hours a week or more, and require that you NOT WORK during the program, in fact a lot of the SPECIFICALLY say that they will remove you from the program if you are found to be in breech of this (No joke!).

### Kerfuffle The Sixth: Finding A Job Afterwards

I’m the type of person, that feels like in these programs, you get out of them, what you put into them. HOWEVER there are alot of different things that factor into a job search and yes while the vast majority of coding bootcamps claim to help you with finding work afterwards, there is absolutely no guarantee that you will find one, I don’t care how much they promise that they will work hard to help you.

There are a lot of people who are left looking for a job from anywhere between 3–6 months, trying to find where they fit in. Unless you were a super star pupil, you’re not going to have a whole lot of luck, and if you struggled in bootcamp and were very lucky to eek out of it, you’re not going to have a good time with the coding problems given to you when you go looking for work. You might get an interview, but that does not guarantee a job.

### Kerfuffle The Seventh: You’re Paying A Mentor To Help You Through Free Resources

Yup, you’ve read that right, you are literally paying thousands of dollars to have someone stand over your shoulder, and teach you something that you can find online. A lot of the coding problems most of these places use, can be found online with the use of good old google. With the solutions at that.

There’s plenty of free communities (Literally everyone has a slack channel now by the way) that you can join, and some folks actually group up and go through these exercises together. There’s even folks who sign up for these communities JUST TO HELP PEOPLE. Will you always get an answer right away? No, but it’ll help you with going at it to hammer at the issue some more while you wait. It’s free, and there’s some pretty awesome folks that hang out in the channels in these places.

### Final Thoughts:

I’m not in anyway knocking anyone who wants to utilize a bootcamp to break into coding, I’m just making sure that if you do decide, you know the risks associated with it, and what to expect. It’s not easy and you won’t be spending a small amount of money to do so. It’s something that should be thought out thoroughly and you have to understand that spending thousands of dollars on this doesn’t guarantee that you’ll even have work afterwards.

Tech is a tricky beast, one minute you’re sitting in the office, yucking it up with your colleagues and the next day everyone shows up to work to a locked door, no lights and a sad, long drawn out email stating that they no longer have jobs because there’s no longer a company.

Basically what I’m saying is, don’t let the happy go lucky, diverse stock photos on the bootcamp website fool you, there are more facets to picking this up than just hitting up some tutorials, and some bootcamps and then BAM you’re sitting cozy open air office with the football table, keg, catered lunches and Xbox One hooked into the big screen. But that’s another blog for another time.
