Starting Hack Reactor, I wrote down a few back-of-the-envelop goals that I wanted to accomplish by the end of the year. Since starting, I’ve talked to a lot of developers, read a lot of blogs, and let my mind wander during my morning runs. Despite attending a boot camp (which has been an invaluable learning experience!), I still want to maintain the ethic of a self-taught programmer, who makes it a personal responsibility to teach him/herself the skills to become successful.

**My main intention remains unchanged. I want to become a software engineer who:**

1. is comfortable learning new technologies and developing in them despite not being an expert yet

2. relishes the hunt of debugging and figuring why software is not acting according to expectations

3. plays well with others — empathetic, fun to work with, and pushes the team forward in moments of indecision

4. clearly communicates complex topics so that people who are exposed to the concept for the first time can understand. Also, speak in a way that gets non-technical people stoked about technical projects!

However, now that I’ve had more exposure to what’s possible in web development, I added a few experiences/ projects that I want to make a priority over the next few months.

Goals kept secret have a way of disappearing or getting rationalized away when things get busy, so in order to make sure I stay committed to them, **I’m posting them publicly:**

1. Create a non-trivial React application with Redux as a state-container and Node as the back-end. This project needs to be well-documented, organized, and have a testing suite.

2. Explore alternative ways of User Interface that are not just browser-based webpages. Either build a mobile project with React Native, a server-side chatbot project, or combine both.

3. Create a useful developer tool that abstracts away a pain point in the development process. Publish this this tool into an npm package that gets 1000 downloads.

4. Continue to produce blog posts that provide value for other developers coming from non-traditional paths, especially veterans, and help solidify my mastery of concepts by using the [learning by teaching approach](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Learning_by_teaching).

5. Maintain my mental, emotional and physical health to allow me to continue to be a good person in stressful situations.

That’s it! There’s a few other things I’d like to do- continue to contribute to Operation Code, look for apartments in LA, run another ultra-marathon- but for the next few months, those are going to have to take a backseat to priorities.

If you’re also becoming a self-taught developer, I’d love to see what your short term goals are- just drop a link in the comments section! I think planning in 3-month intervals allows you to stay flexible and keep yourself accountable over the short term.
