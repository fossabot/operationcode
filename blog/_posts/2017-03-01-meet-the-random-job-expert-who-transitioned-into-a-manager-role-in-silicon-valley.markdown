Meet Andrea, a self-described random job expert. After her service as a U.S. Army Human Resource Specialist she held many jobs and admits, “I never really found that one thing that really drove me.” One day a serendipitous online search resulted in more than she expected. 

“I googled veterans + coding” says Andrea. It listed two results, one of them was Operation Code. As she scrolled the Operation Code webpage she learned that the non-profit organization’s mission is to aid military vets and their families learn code and web technology. She decided to reach out.

Initially, because she had no previous program experience, she lacked confidence. 
Andrea acknowledged to herself and to others that a new skill would be difficult to learn. Given that her GI Bill benefits had come and gone (without her tapping into them) she specifically sought career advancement resources which wouldn’t cost a lot of money.

Then Operation Code offered to set her up with a mentor, which they did. According to Conrad Hollomon, Operation Code’s Chief of Staff, mentorship is “absolutely critical” in helping someone reach their greatest potential in the tech industry.

Andrea was now engaging in online communities focused on everything from open source to coding. With a combination of her do-it-yourself learning and mentor support her confidence increased. Furthermore, she believed her military background and entrepreneurial spirit made her special. But was she ready to apply for a job in tech?

Then one day Andrea opened her inbox. She received a job announcement which had been forwarded to her by David Molina, Operation Code’s Founder & CEO. The employer was Github. Yes, Github; the multi-million dollar software company operating out of Silicon Valley. She was initially apprehensive about applying, mainly for family reasons. But after careful consideration and conversations with her supportive partner, she applied. After a four month process she received the job offer last November. “January 10th was my first day on the job” shares Andrea who credits Operation Code and the resources they shared with making the difference.
